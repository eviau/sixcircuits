    <p><i>based on Italo Calvino's essay, "Six memos for the new millenium"</i></p>
<h2>What is a circuit?</h2>
<p>A circuit is a software-based writing game. By 'writing game', we mean a game where the main interaction is through the written word.</p>

<p>These circuits have been created with Italo Calvino essay "Six memos for the next millenium" in mind. There is one circuit by memo.</p>
<h2>Let's get started!</h2>
<p>Each circuit links to the next. Upon completion of all the circuits, you will be able to access them in the order of your choice.</p>
