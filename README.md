# Six circuits for the new millenium
*a game about writing, based on Italo Calvino works*

## the concept

The concept for these games about writing is simple: there are a series of writing prompt for each section of the essay *Six memos for the next millenium* by Italo Calvino.

## why italo calvino

Being a mathematician and a fan of the oulipo, and having read some of Calvino's works, I was enthusiastic at the idea of joigning the game jam *If on a summer's night a game designer...* - the page is available on [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/calvino2020).

Created by Antonio Amato, this jam was all about creating digital or analog games based on the works of Calvino.

## where can I play?

the app can be played on [glitch](https://sixcircuits.glitch.me/).

be careful, i have yet to implement a way to save results :/ and I am not sure how glitch treats text inputs in order to be able to display them on your screen, i.e. although I am not saving them anywhere, maybe glitch is?

you may also use this repo to have a local copy of the game, running on your own computer only :)
