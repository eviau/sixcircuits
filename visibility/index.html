<h1>Visibility</h1>

<p>Now, let's create a picture - with words.</p>
<p>Let's say we are now in a deep forest on a new planet. What do you see? How do you feel? Have you been before?</p>
<p>Tell me how the forest is layed out. Tell me about the animals that inhabits its trees.</p>
<p>Can you make the scent visible? Can we see the wind?</p>
<p>(You may also decide to make visible something else than a forest. I won't tell!)</p>
